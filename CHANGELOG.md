## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-XX

### 🚀 Major Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Complete refactoring from monolithic 1,272-line flow.py to specialized modules
- **Multi-Deployment Support**: Added Docker, UV, and traditional pip deployment options
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Separated user (README.md) and developer (DEVELOPER.md) documentation
- **Production-Ready**: Added comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### 🏗️ Architecture Changes

- **ArchitecturePlanner** (`architecture_planner.py`): Extracted system design and UI prevention logic
- **ModuleCreator** (`module_creator.py`): Extracted module creation with retry logic and validation
- **SystemAssembler** (`system_assembler.py`): Extracted integration, testing, and demo creation
- **Configuration** (`config.py`): Centralized configuration and path management
- **Flow Orchestrator** (`flow.py`): Streamlined to 58 lines, focuses on coordination only

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Self-Correcting Retry Logic**: Improved error handling with targeted feedback
- **Interface Validation**: AST-based interface extraction and validation
- **Timing Fixes**: Resolved integration validation timing issues

- **Gradio**: Updated to >=5.22.0 for modern UI capabilities
- **Pydantic**: Updated to >=2.0.0 for improved data validation
- **Development Tools**: Added comprehensive development dependencies

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Integration Validation**: Fixed false positive "integration issues" by correcting validation timing
- **Path Management**: Centralized path handling to prevent hardcoded path issues
- **Script References**: Fixed broken script references in pyproject.toml
- **Module Dependencies**: Improved dependency resolution and ordering
- **Docker Permissions**: Fixed PermissionError with appuser home directory and CrewAI storage paths
- **Container Restart**: Resolved Docker container restart loop caused by permission issues

### 📝 Configuration

- **pyproject.toml**: Complete overhaul with UV support and comprehensive metadata
- **Docker Configuration**: Multi-stage builds with development and production optimizations
- **Environment Variables**: Comprehensive .env.example with documentation
- **Git Configuration**: Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive exclusions

### 🔄 Migration Guide

**From v1.x to v2.0.0:**

1. **Installation**: Use new deployment methods (Docker, UV, or pip)
2. **Configuration**: Update .env file using new .env.example template
3. **API Changes**: Flow class interface remains compatible
4. **Output Structure**: Generated project structure unchanged

### 🎯 Breaking Changes

- **Minimum Python Version**: Now requires Python 3.10+
- **Dependencies**: Some optional dependencies moved to dev extras
